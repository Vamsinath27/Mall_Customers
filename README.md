# Mall_Customers

## Project Overview
This project focuses on clustering mall customers using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors, which can help in targeted marketing strategies. The project implements KMeans and hierarchical clustering algorithms, both of which identify 5 optimal clusters.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mall_Customers.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

cd Mall_Customers

Install the required packages:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    bash

    jupyter notebook

    Run the notebook Mall_Customers_Clustering.ipynb to explore the clustering techniques.
    Follow the instructions within the notebook to understand the steps and visualize the clustering results.

Dataset

Clustering Methods

The following clustering methods were implemented:

    KMeans Clustering: This algorithm partitions the customers into 5 clusters based on their features.
    Hierarchical Clustering: This method also resulted in 5 optimal clusters, providing an alternative perspective on customer segmentation.

Results

Both clustering techniques identified 5 optimal clusters, which can be visualized in the provided notebook. Insights derived from these clusters can inform marketing strategies and customer engagement.
